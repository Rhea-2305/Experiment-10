# Experiment-10
## Program 1
## Aim
Declare and initialize pointers of different data types and print the following values (Repeat for float and char data types)

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
In C++, a pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. To declare a pointer, you specify the type of the variable it will point to, followed by an asterisk (*). Pointers need to be initialized with the address of a variable, which is obtained using the address-of operator (&). They are essential for dynamic memory management, handling arrays, and passing arguments efficiently to functions.
